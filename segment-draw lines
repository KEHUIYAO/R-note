segments(x0, y0, x1 = x0, y1 = y0,
         col = par("fg"), lty = par("lty"), lwd = par("lwd"),
         ...)
Details

For each i, a line segment is drawn between the point (x0[i], y0[i]) and the point (x1[i], y1[i]). The coordinate vectors will be recycled to the length of the longest.

The graphical parameters col, lty and lwd can be vectors of length greater than one and will be recycled if necessary.
